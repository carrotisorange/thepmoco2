      If you've ever tried to manage a property, you know how hard it can be. From accounting for rent payments to tracking expenses, there are just so many things that need to get doneâ€”and there's no way to do them all manually. Now imagine if you could streamline all those processes with an automated system like the  Leasing Management System (PMS) of The PMO Co. This new tool will help your organization run more efficiently by automating everything from invoicing vendors to tracking work orders.

      <p class="pb-6">
      To help ensure that rent are paid on time, you'll need to import the information from your other systems. This can include:
        <ul class="pb-6">
            <li>tenant information - name and address</li>
            <li>contract details </li>
            <li>performance reviews</li>
            <li class="mt-3">- what they've paid previously and when is the next due date - how much money is due</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="pb-6">
      If you have a lot of tenants, this can be quite a process. In addition to the time it takes to gather all the information together, there are also technical hurdles to overcome when trying to share data between systems.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-6">
      You'll need to make sure that the data you're trying to import is formatted correctly, and that all the relevant fields are included. If some information is missing or incorrect, it can have a big impact on your operations. You may end up collecting less than you should or causing an invoice to be rejected because someone didn't fill in their phone number properly.

       Work orders are a way of tracking maintenance and repairs to your properties, ensuring that they are done in the right order. They can be created from the property management system, assigned to specific maintenance staff, and tracked by date and status.
      </p>
       <p class="pb-6">
       With a work order system, you can: - Keep track of all maintenance and repairs in one place - Track the status of each order as it is completed and assigned to different staff members
      </p>
        <ul class="pb-6>">
        <li>- Monitor the progress of a work order by date and status - Review all maintenance requests from your tenants</li>
        <li>- Assign work orders to specific maintenance staff - Track the status of each order as it is completed and assigned to different staff members</li>

        </h3>
    <p class="pb-6">
    As you are managing your properties, the first thing that you should look for is a property management system. The reason for this is simple: it will help you keep track of all the information and ensure that everything is being done correctly.
      </p>
       <p class="pb-6">
       For example, if there are any problems with billing tenants or getting paid on time, then they can be fixed quickly by using this system. It also makes it easier to manage cash flow by making sure that invoices are paid within days rather than weeks or months later. This means less time spent chasing up late payments and more time focused on other aspects of running a successful business!</p>
