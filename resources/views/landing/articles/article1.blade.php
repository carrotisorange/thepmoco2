          When we first started out as property managers, we followed the old-school methods. During leasing procedures, we used the traditional way of paper and pen to sign up tenant info sheets, contracts, billing statements, and receipts. It took an entire day to process a single report! 
      </p>
      <p class="pb-6">
          At one point, our operations are so wrapped up in administrative work that we are spending less time strengthening our customer relations. We spend so much time looking for documents and less time on satisfying customer requests.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-6">
          Hereâ€™s where we need to innovate and rejuvenate.

          But the good old days are long gone; we need to advance and adapt to the technological evolution! And before you know it, we have built The PMO for all landlords and professional property managers out there who, like us, want to make work easier and better.

      <p class="pb-6">
          Automating our process enables us to increase customer service satisfaction, become efficient in our operations, and improve transparency in management.</p>
