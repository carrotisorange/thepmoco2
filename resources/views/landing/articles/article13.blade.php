      Improving building security can involve a variety of measures, some of which include:
      </p>
     
    <ol class="pb-6 list-decimal">
      <li class="pl-5 py-2"><span class="font-bold">Access control:</span> Implementing an access control system, such as
keycard entry or biometric identification, can limit access to the
building to authorized personnel only.</li>
      <li class="pl-5 py-2"><span class="font-bold">Surveillance cameras:</span> Installing surveillance cameras at strategic
locations throughout the building can deter criminal activity and
assist in investigations if a crime occurs. CCTV cameras in
commercial properties is now a requirement for business permit and
license issuance in some cities.</li>
      <li class="pl-5 py-2"><span class="font-bold">Lighting:</span> Adequate lighting, both inside and outside the building,
can help improve security by deterring criminals and making it
easier to identify them if they do approach. Well lit front, back, sides
of a building not only improves external aesthetics of the building at
night but also makes the property noticeable to passersby and too
risky for bad elements to get into.</li>
      <li class="pl-5 py-2"><span class="font-bold">Physical barriers:</span> Installing physical barriers, such as fencing,
bollards, or security gates, can prevent unauthorized vehicles, and
pedestrians from accessing the building.</li>
      <li class="pl-5 py-2"><span class="font-bold">Alarms:</span> Installing an alarm system can alert authorities and
building occupants if a crime or emergency occurs.</li>
      <li class="pl-5 py-2"><span class="font-bold">Training for employees:</span>Regular training for employees on
security awareness, emergency procedures, and how to identify and
report suspicious behavior can help improve the overall security of
the building.</li>
      <li class="pl-5 py-2"><span class="font-bold">Regular security assessments:</span> Regular security assessments can
help identify potential security vulnerabilities and ensure that
security measures are effective and up-to-date.</li>
      <li class="pl-5 py-2"><span class="font-bold">Hire security guards or a security agency:</span> A building feels safer when a professional trained on assessing security risks and keeping an eye for potential danger is present. A security guard is a good deterrent to potential harm to the property or residents. The benefit of providing safe and secure place to tenants and peace of mind far outweighs the security cost especially for professionally managed properties.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="pb-6 mt-10">
    It is also important to have a plan in place for responding to security incidents, such as a security breach or natural disaster, and to regularly review and update the plan as needed.
